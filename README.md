# iPlaylist
A simple web app where you can create your own playlist and add your own music. Three people including me collaborated on this project together. I mostly did the HTML and CSS part of the project while my other friends did the back end. To use the app first you have to log in to the website. We keep a simple database of accounts that are registered so if you aren't, you can't log in. And then you can add your own song to your own playlist by providing the name of the song and the mp3 file. The list of songs is stored in our database so you won't lose your data when you quit the app. You can also remove or rename the songs in your playlist.

# What I learned
- Little bit of PHP
- Database
